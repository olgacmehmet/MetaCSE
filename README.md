## Introduction

The **MetaCSE** project seeks to enhance the way users search for information online. Traditional search engines often return results that are influenced by algorithms and advertising. In contrast, MetaCSE pulls data from various platforms, allowing users to find the most relevant content without bias.

### Why Meta Search?

Meta search engines aggregate results from multiple search engines, providing a broader perspective. They save time and effort, ensuring users access diverse information quickly.

## Features

- **Multi-source Aggregation**: Combines results from various search engines.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.
- **Customizable Filters**: Allows users to refine their searches based on specific criteria.
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuously pulls the latest information from the web.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensures user data is protected and not tracked.
